# Kitchen Tips

## Time-Saving Hacks

- **Prep ingredients in advance:** Chop veggies and store them in airtight containers for quick cooking.  
- **Use kitchen gadgets:** A slow cooker or instant pot can be a lifesaver for busy days.  
- **Clean as you go:** Keeps your workspace tidy and reduces post-cooking cleanup time.

## Cooking Hacks

- Use an onion half to clean your grill naturally and remove residue.  
- Add a spoonful of hot oil to your tempering to intensify flavors.  
- To soften garlic quickly, microwave it for 10 seconds before peeling.  
- When boiling pasta, add salt only after water reaches a rolling boil for better seasoning.

## Storage Tips

- Store fresh herbs wrapped in a damp paper towel inside a plastic bag to keep them fresh longer.  
- Freeze leftover curry in silicone molds for easy single-portion meals.  
- Keep potatoes in a cool, dark place — never in the fridge — to avoid sprouting.  
- Use vinegar in your fridge’s water spray bottle to naturally remove odors.

## Safety Tips

- Always use separate cutting boards for raw meat and vegetables to avoid cross-contamination.  
- Keep knives sharp — a dull knife is more dangerous because it slips easily.  
- Store spices away from direct sunlight to preserve their flavor.
